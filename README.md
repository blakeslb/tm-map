## About the Project

"TM-map" or Therapy Matcher Map is an interactive map I created for the NASW MA Therapy Matcher database (a directory used by social workers to find therapists for users of the service). 

In the current system, if you want to search for a therapist by location, each city or town corresponds to a letter of the alphabet from A-Z. Those letters, or regional codes, are used to query the database. This is a somewhat frustrating method, as it is not intuitive to remember which letters correspond to which areas, especially if one is not from Massachusetts. The former solution was to look up the code on a plain text list and separately reference a map to see where the town is situated. I created this map as a shortcut to visually identify the regional code by hovering over the town on the map, for a quicker search.

## Demo

## Usage
Hover over a town or city on the map to see an info-window containing the regional code. If one does not exist, you will only see the town name.

## Built With

Simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. I downloaded an SVG file from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) for the state map.
